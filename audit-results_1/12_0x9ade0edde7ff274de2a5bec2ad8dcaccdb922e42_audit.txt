================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
The given contract suite includes core upgrade proxy contracts based on the ERC1967 standard with admin management via ProxyAdmin. There are multiple critical risks: (1) improper visibility on critical functions (e.g. Ownable's renounceOwnership, transferOwnership, and upgrade mechanisms), (2) upgrade and admin functions lack adequate access control mechanisms if ProxyAdmin is not properly managed, (3) proxy fallback/admin split can be circumvented by manipulating storage layout or admin key, (4) no explicit protection against reentrancy in delegate calls to arbitrary implementations, (5) beacon and implementation pointers can be changed to malicious contracts, (6) Proxy lacks an implementation check on fallback, potentially exposing the proxy to delegate calls to address(0) if mis-Upgraded, (7) there is no event emission or mechanism to restrict proxy upgrades to compatible implementations. These issues may result in permanent loss of contract control, upgrade to malicious contracts, or theft of assets.


Critical Issues Found:

1. Upgradeability: Arbitrary Implementation/Beacon Assignment
   Type: Unrestricted Upgrade/Beacon Assignment
   Function: _upgradeTo,_upgradeToAndCall,_upgradeBeaconToAndCall,upgradeTo,upgradeToAndCall,changeProxyAdmin
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A compromised or malicious admin/owner can upgrade the implementation or beacon to a contract with arbitrary code, including code that facilitates theft or disables all contract operations.
   
   Impact:
   Complete loss of control, theft of funds, or permanent locking of proxy logic.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


2. Ownable: Owner Can Be Irrecoverably Renounced
   Type: Ownership Renouncement to Zero Address
   Function: renounceOwnership
   
   Attack Scenario:
   Owner can call renounceOwnership, setting owner to address(0), which disables all onlyOwner functions including upgrades and admin changes, permanently bricking the contract's admin functions.
   
   Impact:
   Contract becomes permanently un-upgradeable and un-administerable.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


3. DelegateCall to Arbitrary Implementation Without Non-Reentrancy or Sanity Checks
   Type: Arbitrary DelegateCall Execution
   Function: _upgradeToAndCall,_upgradeBeaconToAndCall,_delegate
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A malicious or compromised implementation could exploit the lack of non-reentrancy or input validation in the upgrade mechanisms to introduce reentrancy or storage collision attacks.
   
   Impact:
   Potential for reentrancy attacks, storage corruption, theft, or logic abuse.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


4. No Checks for UUPS Compliance By Default
   Type: Lack of UUPS Upgrade Safety
   Function: _upgradeTo,upgrade,upgradeTo
   
   Attack Scenario:
   An upgrade to a non-UUPS implementation can occur unless optional _upgradeToAndCallUUPS is used, breaking upgradeability or bricking the proxy.
   
   Impact:
   Proxy may be permanently bricked or made unsafe via upgrade.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


5. Admin Access Centralization in ProxyAdmin
   Type: Single Point of Failure in Admin Contract
   Function: changeProxyAdmin,upgrade,upgradeAndCall
   
   Attack Scenario:
   Compromise of ProxyAdmin or its owner account results in admin-level control over all proxies and can lead to mass upgrades or asset theft.
   
   Impact:
   Catastrophic multi-contract compromise.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined
