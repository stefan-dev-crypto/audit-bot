================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
The DolomiteMargin contract contains a critical vulnerability in its constructor by using tx.origin for assigning ownership, allowing for potential ownership hijack via contract deployment through a contract wallet. The contract also contains a business logic flaw in its Ownable implementation, wherein ownership can be renounced, which may result in irrevocable loss of privileged access to sensitive administrative functions.


Critical Issues Found:

1. Insecure Ownership Assignment Using tx.origin
   Type: External Influence on Trust Variables / Ownership Takeover
   Function: constructor
   
   Attack Scenario:
   If a user deploys DolomiteMargin from a contract (rather than an EOA), the tx.origin would be that EOA and not msg.sender (the deploying contract), which could result in the EOA being assigned as the privileged owner instead of the actual deployer. This allows an attacker, by tricking a user into deploying via a malicious contract, to gain ownership over the DolomiteMargin contract.
   
   Impact:
   Attacker could take control of all administrative functions of the protocol, including withdrawals, adding/removing markets, updating oracles, or draining funds.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined
