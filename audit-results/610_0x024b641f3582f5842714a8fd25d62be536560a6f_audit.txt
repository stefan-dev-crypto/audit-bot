================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
The SiloRouterV2 contract exposes a 'multicall' function that allows a general external attacker to execute arbitrary delegatecall operations to a completely untrusted IMPLEMENTATION address, resulting in the ability to steal ETH or any ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155 tokens held by the router contract.

Attack Surface: ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155


Critical Issues Found:

1. Delegatecall to Untrusted Implementation Allows Arbitrary Code Execution
   Type: Arbitrary Delegatecall / Proxy Hijack
   Function: multicall
   
   Attack Scenario:
   An external attacker calls the 'multicall' function with crafted calldata such that, via delegatecall to IMPLEMENTATION, any code of their choice (including standard ERC20/ETH/token transfer or selfdestruct) can be executed in the context of the SiloRouterV2 contract. This enables draining of all ETH (via transfer or selfdestruct), theft of any ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155 token balances held by the router, and/or permanent locking or destruction of the contract.
   
   Impact:
   Complete theft of all ETH and tokens stored in the router contract, plus potential bricking/permanent lockup via selfdestruct or storage manipulation.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   Remove or tightly restrict delegatecall functionality. Only allow known safe validated function selectors, and/or consider using call instead of delegatecall if delegating privilege is not required. Never expose raw delegatecall to untrusted external input.
