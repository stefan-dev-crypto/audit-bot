================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Potential Unlimited dEURO Mint via Unrestricted _mint
   Type: Business Logic/Error Handling Flaw
   Contract: StablecoinBridge
   Function: _mint, mint, mintTo
   Line Numbers: StablecoinBridge._mint (calls dEURO.mint, then increments minted, then checks > limit), StablecoinBridge.mint, StablecoinBridge.mintTo
   
   Attack Scenario:
   Any user can call mint or mintTo repeatedly (either through multiple accounts or potentially inflation attacks) to mint dEURO as long as horizon is not expired. The check for minted <= limit (Limit revert) is done only AFTER the mint, not before. The current transaction may push minted over the limit, but dEURO.mint is already called with the excess, and only then revert is triggered.
   
   Impact:
   The contract allows exceeding the predefined minted limit for dEURO tokens, potentially resulting in excess dEURO exposure and financial losses.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A




Critical Business Logic Flaws Found:

1. Unchecked return from dEURO.mint allows unlimited mint if dEURO.mint does not revert
   Type: Missing Invariant/Unchecked External Call
   Contract: StablecoinBridge
   Function: _mint
   Line Numbers: StablecoinBridge._mint
   
   Attack Scenario:
   If the external dEURO.mint does not revert on failure, but silently succeeds (e.g., always returns true or is a dummy contract), the minted value is incremented regardless, and the apparent control on limit and accounting can be bypassed.
   
   Impact:
   Bridged monetary policy is easily broken by integrating with a malicious dEURO implementation. Users or attackers could arbitrarily mint or break accounting.
