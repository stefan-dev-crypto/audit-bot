================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
The contract exposes a 'multicall' function that delegates arbitrary calldata to a user-supplied implementation contract (the IMPLEMENTATION address). Because delegates calls preserve msg.sender and storage context, if the IMPLEMENTATION is not immutable and 100% trusted, or if it contains unsafe logic accessible by the public, a general user can steal or permanently lock any tokens or ETH held by this router. Even with trusted code, exposing arbitrary delegatecall like this is extremely dangerous without extensive restrictions and verification.

Attack Surface: ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155


Critical Issues Found:

1. Arbitrary External Delegatecall via multicall
   Type: Arbitrary Delegatecall (Proxy Abuse)
   Function: multicall(bytes[] calldata data)
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A general user calls multicall with arbitrary data, which is delegated to the IMPLEMENTATION contract. If the IMPLEMENTATION contract exposes any code path that allows a general caller to move tokens or ETH from SiloRouterV2, the attacker can drain all funds by crafting the right calldata. Since delegatecall runs in the router's storage context but preserves msg.sender, even non-owner users can exploit public/external methods. If the IMPLEMENTATION is upgradable by any means or becomes malicious, the risk is magnified. This is equivalent to an open arbitrary delegatecall—one of the most critical Solidity vulnerabilities.
   
   Impact:
   Stealing or permanently locking all ETH, ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155 tokens held by the SiloRouterV2 contract.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   Remove or highly restrict the multicall's use of delegatecall. Only allow whitelisted function selectors/callers, or use call instead of delegatecall if intended only for external calls. Do NOT expose delegatecall to arbitrary user input unless every possible delegated call is 100% safe for general users to trigger.
