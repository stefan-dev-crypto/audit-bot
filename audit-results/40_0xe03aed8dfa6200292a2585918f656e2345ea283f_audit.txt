================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Missing isValidMintlayerAddress implementation in contract
   Type: Uninitialized/Undefined Function Call
   Contract: TokenBurner
   Function: burnTokens
   Line Numbers: 13
   
   Attack Scenario:
   The burnTokens function calls isValidMintlayerAddress, but the function is not implemented in the contract. This will cause the contract to not compile or be deployable, but if it were mistakenly interpreted by a developer who then adds an insecure dummy implementation, an attacker could bypass validation and burn with any string.
   
   Impact:
   This could allow token burning with arbitrary addresses, leading to confusion, event spoofing, and potentially enable false proof of burn workflows.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A


2. No Actual Token Burning Performed
   Type: Missing Token Burn Mechanism
   Contract: TokenBurner
   Function: burnTokens
   Line Numbers: 16
   
   Attack Scenario:
   The contract collects tokens using transferFrom, but never actually destroys them (no call to token.burn or transfer to 0x0 or to an irrecoverable address). A malicious contract owner could later withdraw the 'burned' tokens.
   
   Impact:
   Users believe their tokens are burned due to the event but the contract retains full custody, opening up risks of a rug pull or double-spend.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A




Critical Business Logic Flaws Found:

1. No Mechanism to Ensure Permanent Token Loss
   Type: Business Logic: False Burn Event/Proof
   Contract: TokenBurner
   Function: burnTokens
   Line Numbers: 16
   
   Attack Scenario:
   As events are emitted when a user 'burns' tokens but the tokens are not sent to an irrecoverable address or destroyed, this contracts enables a false 'proof of burn', which can be exploited for fraudulent cross-chain or redemption claiming.
   
   Impact:
   Users and protocols relying on event logs for burn proof are misled; tokens can be re-used by contract or malicious actors.
