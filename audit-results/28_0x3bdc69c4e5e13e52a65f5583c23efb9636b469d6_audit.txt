================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
The contracts present several critical security issues and business logic flaws, including missing access controls in core ERC20 functions, an unguarded 'burn' function invocation in the RocketVault contract, and reliance on string-based contractName (risking collision or spoofing). There is also a lack of input validation in cross-contract calls, and token management may be bypassed to drain assets or result in inconsistent balances, all of which could be exploited to cause significant loss of funds.


Critical Issues Found:

1. Unprotected Internal Mint/Burn Functions
   Type: Missing Access Control
   Function: _mint,_burn
   
   Attack Scenario:
   Any internal child contract (or inheritor, especially malicious ones) can arbitrarily mint or burn tokens because _mint and _burn are internal and not access-restricted.
   
   Impact:
   Unlimited minting or burning of tokens can be performed, fully compromising the tokenomics and leading to a loss of trust or devaluation.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


2. Unsafe Direct Call to 'burn' on External Tokens
   Type: Arbitrary Token Loss via Insecure Burn Invocation
   Function: burnToken
   
   Attack Scenario:
   The burnToken() function in RocketVault invokes the burn() method on any address provided as _tokenAddress, assuming it is a valid ERC20Burnable token. A malicious or buggy token could cause arbitrary code execution, revert, or drain vault funds unexpectedly.
   
   Impact:
   Vault funds may be drained or permanently lost; arbitrary code execution risk if a token implements a malicious burn function.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


3. No Verification on Token Interfaces (IERC20, ERC20Burnable)
   Type: Unchecked External Contract Call
   Function: depositToken,withdrawToken,burnToken
   
   Attack Scenario:
   When tokens are deposited, withdrawn, or burned, the code incorrectly assumes compliant implementations; hostile implementations could cause the contract to lock, lose, or misattribute tokens.
   
   Impact:
   Assets can be lost or misattributed, including permanent loss or the inability to recover assets controlled by malicious token contracts.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


4. Reentrancy Possible in `withdrawEther` (No Reentrancy Guard)
   Type: Reentrancy
   Function: withdrawEther
   
   Attack Scenario:
   Calling withdrawer.receiveVaultWithdrawalETH{value: _amount}() sends ETH and transfers control to an external contract, which could recursively call withdrawEther, draining the vault.
   
   Impact:
   Complete loss of all Ether held in the vault.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined
