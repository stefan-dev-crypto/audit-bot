================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
A general external attacker can exploit the receive() function of SophonFarmingProxy to repeatedly trigger delegatecall to the implementation contract with empty calldata. If the implementation contract does not correctly restrict what can be called with empty calldata, this could lead to the execution of unintended functions, potentially resulting in theft or permanent loss of ETH/tokens, depending on the actual implementation contract deployed.

Attack Surface: ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155


Critical Issues Found:

1. Unrestricted delegatecall in receive() can lead to theft of ETH/tokens or permanent lock
   Type: Delegatecall Execution of Arbitrary Fallback/Receive
   Function: SophonFarmingProxy.receive()
   
   Attack Scenario:
   An attacker sends ETH to the contract, triggering the receive() function which performs a delegatecall to the implementation contract with empty calldata. If the implementation's fallback or receive function executes logic that allows withdrawal, selfdestruct, or reentrancy, an attacker could steal ETH or tokens, or permanently lock the contract's funds.
   
   Impact:
   Complete theft or lock of ETH and/or tokens held by the contract, dependent on logic in the delegated implementation contract.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   Remove the delegatecall from the receive() function or ensure the implementation fallback/receive does not allow any sensitive/state-changing actions, including withdrawals or upgrades, when called with empty calldata and Ether.
