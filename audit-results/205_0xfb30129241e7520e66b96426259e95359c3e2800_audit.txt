Source File: 205_0xfb30129241e7520e66b96426259e95359c3e2800.sol
Audit Date: 2026-01-14T17:50:50.919Z
Model: gpt-4.1

================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
Any external user can overwrite critical storage slots (owner, implementation, etc.) and deploy arbitrary implementation code due to the unprotected setStorage and setCode functions. This allows full control over the proxy and theft or permanent lock of ETH/tokens held by the contract.

Attack Surface: ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155


Critical Issues Found:

1. Unrestricted Write Access to Arbitrary Storage
   Type: Arbitrary Storage Write
   Function: setStorage(bytes32 _key, bytes32 _value)
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A general external user calls setStorage to overwrite OWNER_KEY and/or IMPLEMENTATION_KEY, giving themselves control to upgrade the logic contract or seize control of assets.
   
   Impact:
   Stealing of all ETH/tokens and/or permanent fund lock or malicious upgrades.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   Restrict setStorage and all state-modifying administrative functions to only the contract owner/admin.


2. Unrestricted Implementation Upgrade
   Type: Unprotected Upgrade Mechanism
   Function: setCode(bytes memory _code)
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A general external user calls setCode to deploy a malicious implementation, granting themselves the ability to drain or lock funds via further proxy calls.
   
   Impact:
   Stealing of all ETH/tokens and/or permanent fund lock.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   Restrict setCode to only be callable by an authorized owner/admin/deployer.
