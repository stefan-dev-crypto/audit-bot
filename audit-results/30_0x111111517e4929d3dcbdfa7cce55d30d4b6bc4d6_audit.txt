================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Uncapped Inflation via convertToV2
   Type: Unlimited Minting/Inflation
   Contract: IchiV2
   Function: convertToV2
   Line Numbers: 91-108
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A malicious (or careless) external user calls convertToV2 repeatedly, each time transferring ICHI V1 tokens into the contract. There is no upper-bound or limit to how many ICHI V2 tokens can be minted via this path. Each call increases totalSupply unbounded, rendering the mint cap in 'mint()' irrelevant for supply control. If the V1 token (ichiV1) is malicious, unbacked, or another contract or token that can be minted at will, the attacker can inflate the V2 supply infinitely, diluting all honest holders.
   
   Impact:
   Severe inflation/dilution of ICHI V2 token and collapse of token value; all existing holders’ shares can be made worthless.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A




Critical Business Logic Flaws Found:

1. Lack of Validation on ICHI V1 Token Address
   Type: Trust Assumption / Initialization
   Contract: IchiV2
   Function: constructor, convertToV2, convertToV1
   Line Numbers: 32, 91-137
   
   Attack Scenario:
   Deployer can initialize the contract with a malicious or non-standard ERC20 token as ichiV1. In such a situation, an attacker or the deployer could implement ICHI V1 with a backdoor mint, transfer, or approve function, allowing arbitrary conversion to V2 with worthless or self-created tokens, breaking the integrity and value backing of ICHI V2.
   
   Impact:
   V2 token becomes unbacked or can be created from nothing using a malicious ICHI V1, leading to all user funds being effectively stolen.
