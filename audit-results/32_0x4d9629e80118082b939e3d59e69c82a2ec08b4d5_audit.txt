================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Missing previewRedeem Implementation Enables Arbitrary Asset Draining
   Type: Unrestricted Asset Release / Insecure Computation of Redemption Amounts
   Contract: TribeRedeemer
   Function: redeem
   Line Numbers: redeem function (implementation missing previewRedeem definition)
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A user can call redeem() with any amount. However, previewRedeem() is undefined, meaning either a fallback or empty implementation is called (or is meant to read from uninitialized storage), which could return arbitrary addresses with amountsOut set to max values or attacker-controlled values. This could result in tokensReceived balances being drained to the attacker on any redeem call.
   
   Impact:
   Attackers could potentially withdraw all tokens held in tokensReceived, or maliciously increase the output in the absence of any implemented logic in previewRedeem(), leading to the loss of all contract-held assets.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A


2. redeemBase Can Underflow
   Type: Arithmetic Underflow (Unchecked subtractions)
   Contract: TribeRedeemer
   Function: redeem
   Line Numbers: redeem function (line: redeemBase = base - amountIn;)
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A user calls redeem() with an amountIn that exceeds redeemBase. This causes redeemBase = base - amountIn to underflow, setting redeemBase to a very high uint256 value. This could either allow unlimited future redemptions or break any logic based on redeemBase.
   
   Impact:
   This can enable infinite asset redemption, bypassing supply constraints, or disrupt business logic reliant on redeemBase.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A




Critical Business Logic Flaws Found:

1. Undefined Logic for previewRedeem Allows Inconsistent or Malicious Redemption Outputs
   Type: Incomplete Core Logic / Trust on External Function
   Contract: TribeRedeemer
   Function: redeem
   Line Numbers: redeem function, call to previewRedeem
   
   Attack Scenario:
   Malicious or misconfigured previewRedeem logic could allow users to redeem one token for excessive or arbitrary amounts of other tokens, leading to loss of assets.
   
   Impact:
   Token reserves can be drained due to incorrect or arbitrary output predictions and transfers.
