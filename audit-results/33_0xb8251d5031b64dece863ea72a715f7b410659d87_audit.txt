================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Upgrade Function Callable By Any User
   Type: Unauthorized Arbitrary Implementation Upgrade (Access Control Bypass)
   Contract: VaultProxy
   Function: upgrade
   Line Numbers: 10-19
   
   Attack Scenario:
   Any external user can call the 'upgrade' function, which unconditionally executes an implementation upgrade if 'shouldUpgrade' returns true. If the current implementation's 'shouldUpgrade' is malicous or simply returns (true, attackersAddress), the attacker can force the proxy to load any contract as its logic, enabling arbitrary code execution, asset theft, or contract bricking.
   
   Impact:
   Critical loss of contract control and assets. Full proxy logic hijack, allowing an attacker to seize funds or irreversibly sabotage the contract.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A




Critical Business Logic Flaws Found:

1. No Access Restriction on Sensitive Upgrade Logic
   Type: Missing Authorization for Upgrade Logic
   Contract: VaultProxy
   Function: upgrade
   Line Numbers: 10-19
   
   Attack Scenario:
   No access control or governance is validated in 'upgrade', nor in '_upgradeTo' / '_setImplementation', allowing anyone (not just privileged roles) to execute permanent, sensitive upgrades.
   
   Impact:
   Contract is perpetually at risk of instant arbitrary upgrades, essentially making it a honeypot or soft target where user confidence and funds are at constant risk.
