================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
The contract contains multiple critical vulnerabilities and business logic flaws. Key issues include missing implementation code that can break execution (FeeCalculator does not return any values for configuration getters, causing runtime failures), lack of access control on some key functions, unguarded allowance setting for potentially malicious tokens, and flawed initialization of admin privileges that can break upgradability or continuation if a single owner is lost. The fee calculation function is difficult to audit due to incomplete or cut-off code. The code also suffers from missing or incomplete context functions that may break inheriting contracts.


Critical Issues Found:

1. FeeCalculator getter functions do not return values
   Type: Logic/Runtime Error
   Function: getFeeConfiguration,getMaxFee,getMinFee,getFeePercentage,getTxnFee
   
   Attack Scenario:
   Any call to getter like getFeeConfiguration will revert, breaking any interaction and all related contract logic.
   
   Impact:
   This breaks all fee calculation logic and can prevent the transfer of tokens.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


2. Token Approval race: Repeated Approve/Increase potentially unsafe
   Type: Token Approval/Allowance Manipulation
   Function: transferTokens
   
   Attack Scenario:
   If burnToken is a malicious ERC20 (non-standard), calling safeIncreaseAllowance and then depositForBurn can be front-run to increase and use the allowance by a malicious contract or token implementation.
   
   Impact:
   Potential fund loss or stuck tokens if non-standard/malicious ERC20s are supported as burnToken.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


3. Uninitialized Admin context in Pausable and Admin contracts
   Type: Admin Role Hijack or Lock-Out
   Function: removeAdmin,pause,unpause,addSupportedBurnToken,addFeeCollector,setFeeConfiguration
   
   Attack Scenario:
   If ownership transfer occurs and no other admin is added, renouncing ownership could leave the contract with no admins, locking all admin-only functions including pause/unpause/fee config.
   
   Impact:
   Permanent breakage of contract logic, making future upgrades/usages impossible.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined
