================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Delegatecall-based Batch Arbitrary Execution
   Type: Arbitrary Delegatecall (Batch Functionality)
   Contract: SablierLockup (through inherited Batch)
   Function: batch
   Line Numbers: Batch.sol: function batch(bytes[] calldata calls)
   
   Attack Scenario:
   The `Batch` contract's `batch(bytes[] calldata calls)` function allows any external user to provide an array of calldata that will be executed via `delegatecall` to the contract itself. Because delegatecall executes code in the context of the caller's storage, a user could invoke any public/external or internal function, bypassing access controls and altering the contract's state. If any function can transfer funds or mint/burn assets, an attacker could invoke those and steal tokens or funds from the contract or users' balances.
   
   Impact:
   Full compromise of contract logic and assets: attackers can mint NFT, transfer tokens, call privileged methods, or extract all contract funds.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A
