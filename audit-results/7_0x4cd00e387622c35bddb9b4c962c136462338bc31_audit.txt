================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Arbitrary External Call Via 'execute' Function
   Type: Arbitrary External Call
   Function: execute, _executeCalls
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A caller can submit an execute() with a valid allocator signature, then make the contract perform arbitrary .call with arbitrary calldata and ETH value to any target contract (external call). If the allocator's key is compromised, or if the key signs unintentionally, all deposited assets (ETH/tokens) in the contract can be drained or sent to arbitrary addresses by executing arbitrary logic.
   
   Impact:
   Critical loss of all assets in the contract (ETH and ERC20s). Potentially enables reentrancy, malicious contract interactions, draining, and more.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


2. Reentrancy Through Arbitrary Call Execution
   Type: Reentrancy
   Function: execute, _executeCalls
   
   Attack Scenario:
   Because execute can call arbitrary contracts with arbitrary calldata and value, it is possible to craft a payload that calls back into this contract’s deposit* or any other payable function, which could lead to unexpected reentrancy issues if further state-modifying methods are added in the future.
   
   Impact:
   Loss of internal contract invariants, potential for double-spend or DoS.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined
