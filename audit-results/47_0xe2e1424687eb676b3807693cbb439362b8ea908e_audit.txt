================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
The StablecoinMinter contract suffers from a critical vulnerability due to an unsafe calculation of DECIMAL_ADJUSTMENT in the constructor, which can result in an underflow and immediate revert if aidDecimals < stablecoinDecimals. The mint functionality allows anyone to mint AID tokens without constraint, solely backed by transfer of stablecoins, without any form of peg enforcement or price oracle checks, critically undermining the security and economic assumptions. Additionally, the use of a low-level boolean return pattern for ERC20 transfer calls makes the contract incompatible with many well-known ERC20 implementations (e.g., USDT). The combine of sweep function with onlyOwner modifier, if exploited by ownership hijacking, allows draining user funds, and the contract contains interface/inheritance errors that would prevent compilation.


Critical Issues Found:

1. Unsafe DECIMAL_ADJUSTMENT Calculation Can Underflow
   Type: Arithmetic Underflow in Constructor
   Function: constructor
   
   Attack Scenario:
   If the provided aid token has fewer decimals than the stablecoin token, the subtraction (aidDecimals - stablecoinDecimals) underflows, causing a revert or unintended behavior.
   
   Impact:
   Contract deployment will revert or the adjustment factor will be incorrect, potentially leading to minting errors or stuck tokens.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


2. Insecure ERC20 transfer/transferFrom Usage
   Type: Incompatible ERC20 Transfer Assumption
   Function: mint,sweep
   
   Attack Scenario:
   If a user interacts using an ERC20 token (like USDT or others) that does not return boolean true on transfer/transferFrom, the call fails even though the transfer succeeds. This may lead to locking user funds or minting with no proper accounting.
   
   Impact:
   Loss of funds and loss of minted tokens; users unable to get their tokens.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


3. Critical Interface/Inheritance Error - Contract Will Not Compile
   Type: Syntax and Interface Declaration Errors
   Function: interface body
   
   Attack Scenario:
   The interface IERC20Metadata is malformed and inherits IERC20, which is not provided, and includes a non-interface function. The contract will not compile. Critically, underlying real contracts would thus contain implementational mistakes.
   
   Impact:
   The contract is not deployable and thus cannot be used. Deployed production contracts may lack interface enforcement or introduce further indirect vulnerabilities if such practice translates into others forms of poor design.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined
