================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Free-mint/arbitrary withdrawals through IssueDebt
   Type: Improper Debt/Collateral Accounting
   Contract: DefaultCollateral
   Function: issueDebt
   Line Numbers: 85-102
   
   Attack Scenario:
   An attacker can call the 'issueDebt' function, which burns their own shares and transfers an equivalent amount of collateral asset from the contract to any recipient. There are no checks that the transferred amount is subject to any actual debt arrangement, nor does it track totalDebt, issuerDebt, recipientDebt, or debt mappings, which are not mutated in any way. Furthermore, the function allows users to drain all collateral from the contract by looping through issueDebt calls up to their balance, potentially draining the entire backing asset with no check on overall solvency.
   
   Impact:
   Unlimited withdrawals of underlying collateral by any token holder up to their balance, with no accounting that prevents theft or abuse, could result in full loss of contract funds.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A




Critical Business Logic Flaws Found:

1. Critical incomplete debt/accounting flows, asset draining
   Type: Partial or missing critical state updates
   Contract: DefaultCollateral
   Function: deposit, withdraw, issueDebt
   Line Numbers: 53-120
   
   Attack Scenario:
   The contract contains totalDebt, issuerDebt, recipientDebt, and debt mappings along with events, but never updates these variables in either deposit, withdraw, or issueDebt. This means critical business logic for debt is completely unimplemented, and anyone can withdraw against their balance, regardless of the supposed totalDebt or other limits. This allows the contract to be fully drained by users that simply deposit and then call issueDebt, with all financial guarantees absent.
   
   Impact:
   Users can exploit the contract to drain all collateral, rendering the whole debt logic useless and defeating any real-world application guarantees.
