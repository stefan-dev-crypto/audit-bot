================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
The contract features several critical security vulnerabilities and business logic flaws. Notably, it lacks checks and events in some sensitive internal operations. The contract's safe math usage is presumed correct due to the use of SafeMath, but several access control and initialization flows are issues. Most critically, key variables such as 'factory' and 'token' are set in the constructor based on msg.sender, which could result in deployment to malicious factories or tokens. There is no protection against re-initialization, proxy upgradeability attacks, or malicious factory implementation. The contract also lacks access control for wrapping/unwrapping: anyone can wrap or unwrap, which may or may not fit the intended tokenomics. Finally, burned tokens are not accounted for in permission checks in `burn` vs. `burnFrom`, which may disrupt role enforcement.


Critical Issues Found:

1. Improper Initialization of 'factory' and 'token' via Arbitrary 'msg.sender'
   Type: Untrusted Initialization
   Function: constructor
   
   Attack Scenario:
   An attacker can deploy the contract passing in a malicious factory contract as msg.sender. This factory's 'parameter()' can be controlled to point to a malicious token, or the embedded core can allow arbitrary addresses to mint/burn.
   
   Impact:
   Potential for arbitrary minting, burning, and unpermissioned control over the wrapped token. At its worst, tokens can be drained or minted at-will.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


2. No Zero Address Checks When Minting or Approving
   Type: Missing Zero Address Check
   Function: _mint,_approve
   
   Attack Scenario:
   If a zero address is passed to mint or approve (or is used as an ERC20 allowance owner, especially important for permit()), tokens could be locked, approvals could become non-revocable, or could present griefing risks.
   
   Impact:
   Token supply can be irretrievably locked or approvals could be permanently broken.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined


3. Use of TransferHelper Without Check For Success on Non-Standard ERC20s
   Type: Non-Compliant ERC20 Transfer Risk
   Function: wrapTo,unwrapTo
   
   Attack Scenario:
   If the wrapped token is a non-standard ERC20 (does not return boolean on transfer/transferFrom), operations may revert or not behave as expected. There is no check for return data.
   
   Impact:
   Tokens could be locked or transferred incorrectly, causing loss of funds.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   undefined
