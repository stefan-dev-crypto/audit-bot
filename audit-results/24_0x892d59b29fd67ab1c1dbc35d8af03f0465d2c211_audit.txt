================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Unprotected Initializer Allows Arbitrary Implementation Takeover
   Type: Unprotected Initializer / Delegatecall Injection
   Contract: InitializableUpgradeabilityProxy
   Function: initialize
   Line Numbers: function initialize(address _factory, bytes memory _data, uint8 _proxyType) public payable
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A general external user can call the `initialize` function on InitializableUpgradeabilityProxy at any time if the implementation is zero, setting the implementation address to a contract controlled by the attacker. This contract could maliciously drain any ether/tokens in the proxy or execute arbitrary logic under the attacker's control using delegatecall.
   
   Impact:
   Attacker can seize full control of the proxy contract, substitute the logic contract, and steal all assets held by users or the contract.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A


2. Proxy Delegation To Attacker-Controlled Implementation
   Type: Delegatecall to Arbitrary Implementation
   Contract: Proxy (via InitializableUpgradeabilityProxy)
   Function: fallback, receive, _fallback, _delegate
   Line Numbers: fallback() external payable, receive() external payable, function _fallback() internal, function _delegate(address implementation) internal
   
   Attack Scenario:
   After gaining control via the unprotected initializer, the attacker sets an implementation with malicious fallback and receive functions to intercept all calls to the proxy and take custody of any user deposits or ETH/tokens sent.
   
   Impact:
   Total loss of user or contract assets controlled by the proxy contract.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A




Critical Business Logic Flaws Found:

1. Initializer is Public and Unrestricted
   Type: Access Control Flaw
   Contract: InitializableUpgradeabilityProxy
   Function: initialize
   Line Numbers: function initialize(address _factory, bytes memory _data, uint8 _proxyType) public payable
   
   Attack Scenario:
   The `initialize` function is public and can be called by anyone at any time if the implementation is address(0) (such as before legitimate setup, or if the implementation is somehow reset by another vulnerability). There are no access checks to restrict usage to only the factory or contract owner.
   
   Impact:
   Any user—including an attacker—can initialize the proxy and take control, breaking assumptions of upgrade/ownership control and enabling theft by logic substitution.
