================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Unrestricted Upgrade Functionality in Constructor
   Type: Unprotected Upgrade/Initialization
   Contract: ERC1967Proxy
   Function: constructor
   Line Numbers: 6-8
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A general external user can front-run the deployment or interact through a factory deployment such that arbitrary implementation and calldata can be supplied to the constructor, resulting in the proxy being initialized with a malicious implementation containing a backdoor (such as selfdestruct, malicious storage logic, or asset draining logic). This can result in permanent and irrecoverable loss or theft of assets controlled by the contract.
   
   Impact:
   Complete loss of contract control and all user/contract assets if evil logic is deployed via _logic address at construction.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A
