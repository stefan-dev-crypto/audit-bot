================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Arbitrary Unlimited Minting via XERC20.mint() Callable by Lockbox
   Type: Unrestricted Mint Arbitrary Amount
   Contract: XERC20Lockbox
   Function: deposit, depositTo, depositNative, depositNativeTo, _deposit
   Line Numbers: 23-28, 32-49, 63-72
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A general external user calls deposit or depositTo on XERC20Lockbox with any _amount, triggering XERC20.mint. If the XERC20 contract's mint function is callable by the lockbox without restriction (as implied by the code and typical proxy/bridge context), a user can mint any amount of XERC20 tokens for themselves by passing any _amount, essentially inflating the token supply arbitrarily.
   
   Impact:
   A malicious user can steal all XERC20 tokens and inflate the total supply, causing loss of value and allowing them to withdraw all underlying native/ERC20 tokens from the lockbox.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A




Critical Business Logic Flaws Found:

1. Missing Validation in Deposit Functions on Amount Value
   Type: Lack of Input Validation
   Contract: XERC20Lockbox
   Function: deposit, depositTo, depositNative, depositNativeTo
   Line Numbers: 23-49
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A user calls deposit, depositTo, or their native equivalents with _amount=0 (or msg.value=0). This will still successfully call XERC20.mint or safeTransfer, potentially triggering downstream business logic, inflating event logs, or opening the door to edge-case manipulation if XERC20 mint logic is not properly guarded.
   
   Impact:
   May allow event spam, zero-value mints, or non-economic actions that could disrupt accounting, monitoring, or integrations relying on Deposit/Withdraw events or balances.
