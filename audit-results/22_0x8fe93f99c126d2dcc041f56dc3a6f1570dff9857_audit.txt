================================ AUDIT RESULT ================================

Critical Vulnerability: 🚨 YES

Summary:
undefined


Critical Issues Found:

1. Unrestricted Arbitrary External Call with User Funds
   Type: Arbitrary External Call / Delegatecall Attack
   Contract: RelendWTokenL1
   Function: depositForAndCall, withdrawToAndCall
   Line Numbers: function depositForAndCall(...), function withdrawToAndCall(...)
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A general external user can call depositForAndCall or withdrawToAndCall, passing any target contract and arbitrary calldata. The contract will forward the provided ETH value (msg.value) and perform an arbitrary call using the Dummy contract, without restriction or validation on _callTarget or _callData. This enables attacks such as calling malicious contracts, making reentrant calls, or draining assets if any integration logic is vulnerable. If users accidentally or maliciously invoke depositForAndCall or withdrawToAndCall to contracts that consume all ETH or revert maliciously, user and protocol assets are at risk.
   
   Impact:
   Loss/theft of user/depositor funds, malicious interactions and potential theft of ERC20 tokens, protocol-level loss of assets if attacker manages to abuse contract logic during arbitrary external calls.
   
   Recommended Fix:
   N/A




Critical Business Logic Flaws Found:

1. No Validation on Ether Transfers During Arbitrary Calls
   Type: Improper Asset Transfer Handling
   Contract: RelendWTokenL1
   Function: depositForAndCall, withdrawToAndCall
   Line Numbers: function depositForAndCall(...),function withdrawToAndCall(...)
   
   Attack Scenario:
   A user can send ETH to depositForAndCall or withdrawToAndCall and the contract will forward this ETH value to any arbitrary external contract, without ensuring that this ETH belongs to the protocol or that it is safe to transfer. This breaks expected asset accounting, may allow users to trick other users, and creates confusion and potential theft vectors if integrations assume ETH is handled securely.
   
   Impact:
   User or protocol ETH may be inadvertently lost to malicious contracts, and accounting bugs may allow attackers to 'launder' ETH through protocol calls. Protocol may lose direct ETH attached.
